# Kafka Streaming Project

# Project Overview
This project implements a real-time data streaming pipeline using Apache Kafka, Apache Spark Streaming, and Cassandra. The pipeline ingests streaming data, processes it in near real-time with Spark, and stores the results in Cassandra for scalable storage and querying.

The project also includes orchestration using Apache Airflow and is containerized using Docker for easy deployment.
